### Compare TaskTales and ThriveTogether:

1. Backend Framework: Django vs FastApi
2. Containerization: Virtual Environment vs Docker
3. Database: SQLite vs PostgreSQL
4. Frontend: HTML vs React
5. Authentication: Built-In Authentication vs Manual Authentication

All five aspects seem simpler for the former; if I can't figure out how to deploy TaskTales,
I don't think I could get how to deploy ThriveTogether. I need to figure out a set rule for deployment, no matter how general it would be.
