### Compare TaskTales and ThriveTogether:

Backend Framework: Django vs FastApi
Containerization: Virtual Environment vs Docker
Database: SQLite vs PostgreSQL
Frontend: HTML vs React
Authentication: Built-In Authentication vs Manual Authentication

All five aspects seem simpler for the former; if I can't figure out how to deploy TaskTales,
I don't think I could get how to deploy ThriveTogether. I need to figure out a set rule for deployment, no matter how general it would be.
